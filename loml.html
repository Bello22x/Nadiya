            When I think of you sometime
            And I wanna spend some time with you
            Just the two of us

        <p>"I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
            I just can't say I don't love you
            'Cause I love you, yeah
            It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
            But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
            Let me tell the truth
            Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
            You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
            You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
            You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
            I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
            I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
            I try to find a reason to pull us apart
            It ain't workin', 'cause you're perfect, and I know that you're worth it
            I can't walk away, oh
            Even though we're goin' through it
            And it makes you feel alone
            Just know that I would die for you
            Baby, I would die for you, yeah
            The distance and the time between us
            It'll never change my mind
            'Cause baby, I would die for you
            Baby, I would die for you."</p>

        <h3>"Rewrite The stars"</h3>
        <p>"You know I want you
            It's not a secret I try to hide
            You know you want me
            So don't keep saying our hands are tied
            You claim it's not in the cards
            And fate is pulling you miles away
            And out of a reach from me
            But you're hearing my heart
            So who can stop me if I decide it's on my destiny?
            What if we rewrite the stars?
            Say you were made to be mine
            Nothing could keep us apart
            You'll be the one I was meant to find
            It's up to you, and it's up to me
            No one could say what we get to be
            So why don't we rewrite the stars?
            And maybe the world could be ours, tonight."</p>

            Oh, I'm a little drunk now, that's why I went to war
            Oh, yeah, you are my sober when I'm on the floor
